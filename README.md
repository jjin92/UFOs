# UFOs
Module 11

## Objectives
Use JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create a website with a dynamic data table. Users can browse various UFO sightings records and filter through five different specifications.

## Resources
*Data resource*
- [UFO sightings record in JavaScript](https://github.com/jjin92/UFOs/blob/master/static/js/app.js)

*Software*
- JavaScript, D3, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

## Solution
1. In the HTML webpage
- Use Bootstrap and css to style the content layout. 
- Add `id` to each user input field, so it can be referenced in the Javascript. 
- Add `id` to the filter button, so it can be referenced by d3.js to listen to the event
- Create place holder for the dynamic table.

## Further development
